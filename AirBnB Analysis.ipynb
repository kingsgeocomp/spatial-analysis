    "# Working with GeoPandas and PySAL\n",
    "\n",
    "We've worked -- and will continue to work -- a lot with pandas, but by default pandas doesn't help us much when want to start working with explicitly geographical data. Ways of working _computationally_ with things like distance and location are increasingly important not only to geographers, but also to data scientists, and this is where we start to move away from purely aspatial statistical analysis into the foundations of a more _geographic_ data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a huge number of modules in Python designed to help you work with geodata, but we are going to focus on the two most important higher-level libraries (since they also provide 'wrappers' around some of the lower-level libraries):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) -- which offers a pandas-like interface to working with geodata. Think of this as your tool for basic data manipulation, transformation, and analysis. You will almost certainly want to [bookmark the documentation](http://geopandas.org/user.html#geodataframe).\n",
    "2. [PySAL](http://pysal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) -- the Python Spatial Analysis Library  provides the spatial analytic functions that we'll need for everything from classification, clustering and point-pattern analysis to autocorrelation-based tools.\n",
    "3. There is some overlap between the two libraries: both can do plotting but, for reasons we'll see later, we'll normally do this in PySAL and both can do classification (remember, we did _quantiles_ with pandas!) but (again), for reasons we'll see later, we'll often do this in PySAL from here on out.\n",
    "\n",
    "PySAL is complicated enough that the best way to understand how it fits together is to use an image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![PySAL Logo](http://darribas.org/gds_scipy16/content/figs/pysal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to concentrate primarily on the ESDA (Exploratory _Spatial_ Data Analysis) and Weights components of PySAL in this module, but you should know about the other bits!"

    "## A (Semi-Brief) Discourse on Families & Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoPandas objects are deliberately designed to resemble Pandas objects. There are two good reasons for this: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Since Pandas is well-known, this makes it easier to learn how to use GeoPandas.\n",
    "2. GeoPandas _inherits_ functionality from Pandas. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of **inheritance** is something we've held off from mentioning until now, but it's definitely worth understanding if you are serious about learning how to code. In effect, geopandas '_imports_' pandas and then _extends_ it so that the more basic class (pandas in this case) learns how to work with geodata... pandas doesn't know how to read shapefiles or make maps, but geopandas does. Same for GeoJSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 'Tree of Life'\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple way to think about inheritance: think of the 'evolutionary trees' you might have seen charting the evolution of organisms over time. At the bottom of the tree is the single-celled animal, and at the other end are humans, whales, wildebeest, etc. We all _inherit_ some basic functionality from that original, simple cell. In between us and that primitive, however, are a whole series of branches: different bits of the tree evolved in different directions and developed different 'functionality'. Some of us have bones. Some have  cartilege. Some are vegetarian, and some are carnivorous. And so on. When you get to the primates we all share certain common 'features' (binocular vision, grasping hands, etc.), but we are _still_ more similar to gorillas than we are to macaques. So gorillas and humans _extend_ the primitive 'primate functionality' with some bonus features (bigger brains, greater strength, etc.) that are useful, while macaques extend it with a slightly different set of features (tails, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tree of Life](http://palaeos.com/systematics/tree/images/treeolif.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 'Tree of Classes'\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance in code works in a similar way: *all* Python classes (lists, pandas, plots, etc.) inherit their most basic functionality from a single primitive 'object' class that itself does very little except to provide a template for what an object should look like. As you move along the inheritance tree you will find more and more complex objects with increasingly advanced features: GeoPandas inherits from Pandas, Bokeh and Seaborn inherit from matplotlib, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "I can't find an image of Python base class inheritance, but I've found an equally useful example of how _anything_ can be modelled using this 'family tree' approach... consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Vehicle Inheritance](http://www.mkonar.org/dogus/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php/python/vehicle.png?w=750&tok=4c7ed7)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were trying to implement a vehicle registration scheme in Python, we would want to start with the most basic category of all: _vehicle_. The vehicle class itself might not do much, but it gives us a template for _all_ vehicles (e.g. it must be registered, it must have a unique license number, etc.). We then _extend_ the functionality of this 'base class' with three intermediate classes: two-wheeled vehicles, cars, and trucks. These, in turn, lead to eight actual vehicle types. These might have _additional_ functionality: a bus might need have a passenger capacity associated with it, while a covnertible might need to be hard- or soft-top. All of this could be expressed in Python as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class vehicle(object): # Inherit from base class\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        ... do something ...\n",
    "\n",
    "class car(vehicle): # Inherit from vehicle\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        ... do other stuff ...\n",
    "\n",
    "class sedan(car): # Inherit from car\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        ... do more stuff ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, when we create a new `sedan`, it automatically 'knows' about vehicles and cars, and can make use of functions like `set_unique_id(<identification>)` even if that function is _only_ specified in the base vehicle class! The thing to remember is that programmers are _lazy_: if they can avoid reinventing the wheel, they will. Object-Oriented Programming using inheritance is a good example of _constructive_ laziness: it saves us having to constantly copy and paste code (for registering a new vehicle or reading in a CSV file) from one class to the next since we can just import it and extent it! \n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance also means that you can always use an instance of a 'more evolved' class in place of one of its ancestors: simplifying things a _bit_, a sedan can automatically do anything that a car can do and, by extension, anything that a vehicle can do. Similarly, since geopandas inherits from pandas if you need to use a geopandas object _as if_ it's a pandas object then that will work! So everything you learned last term for pandas can still be used in geopandas. Kind of cool, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, looking back at our example above: what about unicycles? Or tracked vehicles like a tank? This is where _design_ comes into the picture: when we're planning out a family tree for our work we need to be careful about what goes where. And there isn't always a single right answer: perhaps we should distinguish between pedal-powered and motor-powered (in which case unicycles, bicycles and tricycles all belong in the same family)? Or perhaps we need to distinguish between wheeled and tracked (in which case we're missing a pair of classes [wheeled, tracked] between 'vehicle' and 'two-wheel, car, truck')? These choices are tremendously important but often very hard to get right.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, that's enough programming theory, let's see this in action..."

    "\n",
    "Similar to what we did last week, I want you to start by creating a map of the world coloured according to population. But this week we're going to do it in GeoPandas instead of Folium.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will need to download the zipped World Borders shapefile from [Thematic Mapping](http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/TM_WORLD_BORDERS_SIMPL-0.3.zip) and save this to your 'shapes' or 'data' folder since GeoPandas can't read 'remote' files. You will also need to unzip the file so that Geopandas can read it.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Remember:_ as long as you have saved the file to somewhere accessible to Jupyter (i.e. a directory _beneath_ the current one where you are working) then you can find out the 'path' to a file by switching to the 'Home' tab in your browser and navigating to the file. You can _also_ find out where the current Notebook is running like this:"
